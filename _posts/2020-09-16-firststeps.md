## Getting a Train Ticket

These machines have several language options for easier navigation while buying your ticket. The user can pay by card or cash. We advise that everyone should buy and validate the ticket before using the services of the Munich Transportation System.
The price of your ticket will depend on where you want to go. Munich is divided in different zones. Further information about it can be found on the [following link](https://www.mvv-muenchen.de/en/tickets-and-fares/tariff-structure/zones/index.html).

#### Steps to buy a ticket 

1. Find the name of the station you want to go to.
2. Go to the Self service machine.
3. From the upper right hand side corner, change the language to English, clicking on the Flag of United Kingdom.
4. Follow the instructions on the screen to buy a ticket based on the Zone you want to travel to. There are different kinds of tickets available for the user such as A single trip ticket, Day ticket, Group day tickets etc. more information can be found [here](https://www.mvv-muenchen.de/en/tickets-and-fares/tickets-daytickets/index.html)  
5. If you are confused about the Zone and are in a hurry, you can use the “Journey Planner” option, this will allow you to type the name of the station you want to go to, and will give you various options of the tickets that you can buy to get there.
6. Payments are to be made on the right side of the machine, it accepts both – Cash and Card.
7. Your ticket and change (in case you use cash) will drop down in the given space below the screen, you can collect it from there.
8. Before entering the platform , or in the bus, you will find a machine similar to the picture below, put the ticket in the machine from the side indicated on the ticket. This will validate your ticket

**Please note that unless you stamp your ticket it will not be considered valid and you can be fined for not buying a ticket.**

## Getting a SIM Card

One of the first steps when you land in a foregin country is buying a local Sim Card.It is very important that you have a local number so that you can use it while filling various forms for your next steps. In Germany, you can buy a sim card from any of the Supermarkets.The four major supermarkets are – Edeka, Aldi, Penny and Rewe.
They are present all around the city, you can find one near your home.There are various plans and cards available, and you can buy according to your need.

After buying a sim card, you need to activate it. In order to activate the sim card, you will need your passport. Unfortunately, Indian passports do not have a biometric chip, this causes some delay in the verification process and you may need to go to Post Bank or some other verification center. Some companies also check and verify your passport details online using a webcam and an agent. It would be better to check on the internet (using the wifi of your house) which plan and verification process would be the best for you.
