Finding an apartment in Munich can be a very daunting task. Following are some tips and advices for a safe and fast apartment search.

First thing is right budget. Don't decide your budget on the basis of your friends or relatives living in another city of Germany. Munich is the most expensive city in the Germany, so decide your budget after seeing some advertisements for the rent.
Writing application in German language help more. You can use translator if you don't know the language, but in common sites you will get reply mostly with requests in german. Don't write how badly you want the apartment, but describe why you are so interesting that someone will give you an apartment or would like to live with you. Mention your hobbies and how social you are.

The general sites can be :

1. [Munichmela.de](www.Munichmela.de) 
2. [Studenten-wg](http://www.studenten-wg.de/)
3. [Mr. Lodge](http://m.mrlodge.com/)
4. [Wg Gesucht](http://www.wg-gesucht.de/en/)
5. [Globimo](http://www.globimmo.net/en/for-rent)
6. [Kalaydo](http://m.kalaydo.de/)
7. [Wochenanzeiger-muenchen](http://www.wochenanzeiger-muenchen.de/anzeigen)
8. [Wohnungsagentur](http://www.cs-wohnungsagentur.de/)
9. [Immobilienscout24](http://www.immobilienscout24.de/m/search/)
10. [Immonet](http://mobil.immonet.de/)

Also, there are some boarding houses where you can stay. These are little bit expensive but you can get KVR from them. For example : [Boardinghaus](www.boardinghaus-freising.de) is one of the options. Freising is little bit oustide Munich, but they provide KVR. Also, Airbnb provides you with KVR but you have to ask these people apriori.

Most importantly, stay away from scams and do check for these points:

1. If someone asks to send you the money and they will send you the key. Never do it.
2. If someone give you a contract and their passport copy and asks you to send money - everything is forged.
3. Someone forgets the key and will meet you somewhere else but not at the apartment - again scam.
4. Also someone making a contract via airbnb and asks you to send money to Airbnb and then airbnb will give you keys is again a scam.
5. You can trust Indian people mostly, but better look the place in video call

There are chances you won't get the best place in your first month, but eventually things will align.

Best wishes!
