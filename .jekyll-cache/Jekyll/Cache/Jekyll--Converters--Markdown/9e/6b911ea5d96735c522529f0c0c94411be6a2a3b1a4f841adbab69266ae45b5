<p><strong>Munich</strong>, Bavaria’s capital, is home to centuries-old buildings and numerous museums. The city is known for its annual <em>Oktoberfest</em> celebration and its beer halls, including the famed <em>Hofbräuhaus</em>, founded in 1589. In the Altstadt (Old Town), central Marienplatz square contains landmarks such as Neo-Gothic Neues Rathaus (town hall), with a popular glockenspiel show that chimes and reenacts stories from the 16th century.</p>
