It is very common in Germany, like any other country to do a part time job while you are enrolled in a full-time master’s degree. What is different here is that, the job usually is relevant to the course contents. You are not expected to work in a restaurant, unless if that is what you want to do here. No job is any lesser, but you are doing a master’s degree in Science for a reason, remember?

## So how does one look for a job?

By now, most of you would have known about [Xing](https://www.xing.com/), a career-oriented social networking site. Even though Xing is not familiar outside Germany, it’s a good place to start with. This platform provides a possibility to meet the potential Employer / peer. Ignoring the structure of your profile (unlike LinkedIn), what could be more interesting is the option to Create Alerts and get notified via email about the openings available currently. I still get at least 2 alerts everyday about the existing working student positions.

Another way is to check the University’s job portal. Most of the universities have their own. For example, Technical University of Munich has this [portal](https://tum-som.com/jobboard/). Not just this one, there are many such portals offered by each department. Visiting the chair’s official page certainly provides more useful information including jobs at the University (Teaching assistant, Lecture Video recording & editing). Did you know that these jobs do not count in the 120 full days/ 240 half days limit for International students? Click here to know more.

The basic and easy way is to visit the Career page of the companies that cross your mind (or a dream company) and apply directly.
Also, don’t forget to attend the Job fairs. Apart from just collecting some stationery, it is definitely a great place to meet the HR directly and get to know about the company, their culture & the current openings. Plan to print your resume and hand a copy over to the HR. In turn, ask for their contacts and follow up via email the next day. Remind them about your interaction in the job fair and mention why you would be a great fit for the particular job role.

These are some ways of how I did find a job in one month after I landed in Munich. It is not going to be a cakewalk, but it’s not that difficult either. Just some dedication is enough. If I could do it, you could too!
