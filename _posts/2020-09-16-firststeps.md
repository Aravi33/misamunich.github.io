You can find the ticket machines as shown above at all the bus stations and train stations in Munich. These machines have several language options for easier navigation while buying your ticket. The user can pay by card or cash.
We advice that everyone should buy and validate the ticket before using the services of the Munich Transportation System.
The price of your ticket will depend on where you want to go. Munich is divided in different zones. Further information about it can be found on the [following link](https://www.mvv-muenchen.de/en/tickets-and-fares/tariff-structure/zones/index.html).

### Steps to buy a ticket 

1) Find the name of the station you want to go to, using google and the address that you need to go to.

## 2. Buying a SIM Card

One of the first steps when you land in a foregin country is buying a local Sim Card.It is very important that you have a local number so that you can use it while filling various forms for your next steps. In Germany, you can buy a sim card from any of the Supermarkets.The four major supermarkets are – **Edeka, Aldi, Penny and Rewe**.
They are present all around the city, you can find one near your home.

There are various plans and cards available, and you can buy according to your need.
After buying a sim card, you need to activate it. In order to activate the sim card, you will need your passport. Unfortunately, Indian passports do not have a biometric chip, this causes some delay in the verification process and you may need to go to Post Bank or some other verification center. Some companies also check and verify your passport details online using a webcam and an agent. It would be better to check on the internet (using the wifi of your house) which plan and verification process would be the best for you.

Some available plans are -
