<p><strong>Liability For Content</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the contents of our website have been compiled with the greatest care, we cannot give any guarantee for the accuracy, completeness or currency of the information provided. As a service-provider, we are responsible under Sec. 7 Para. 1 German Telecommunications Act (TMG) for our own content on this site in accordance with general regulations. Under Secs. 8 to 10 TMG however, we are not obliged as a service-provider to check external information provided, or to look for circumstances which might indicate any illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general legal regulations remain unaffected. Any such liability in this respect is however only possible from the time of awareness of an actual legal infringement. If we become aware of such legal infringements, the relevant content will be removed immediately.</span></p>
<p><strong>Liability For Links</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our website contains links to external websites of third parties, over whose content we have no control. We can therefore give no guarantee for these external content. The relevant operators or providers of such sites are exclusively responsible for the content of such linked sites. The linked sites were checked for possible legal infringements at the time of creating the respective links. The linked sites did not contain any illegal contents at the time of creating the links. Permanently checking the content of such linked sites, however, is beyond the scope of practical possibilities without firm suspicion of legal infringement. If we become aware of such legal infringements, such links will be removed from our site immediately.</span></p>
<p><strong>Copyright</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The contents and works created by the website operator on this site are subject to the copyright laws of the Federal Republic of Germany. The duplication, editing, distribution and any form of use outside the bounds of copyright law require the written consent of the relevant author or producer. Downloads and copies of this site are allowed only for private use, and not for commercial purposes. In cases where the contents of this site were not produced by the operator, the copyright of third parties has been observed. Contents produced by third parties are clearly designated as such. If you nevertheless become aware of a copyright infringement, please notify us accordingly. If we become aware of such legal infringements, the respective content will be removed immediately.</span></p>
<p><strong>Data Protection</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of our website is generally possible without the provision of personal data. In places where our website provides options for entering personal data (name, address, email addresses), this is always done on a strictly voluntary basis. These data will not be disclosed to third parties without your expressed consent.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We would like to point out that the internet is not a secure medium and that data transmission on the internet (e.g. when communicating via email) is not necessarily secure. Complete protection of the data against access by third parties is not possible.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of contact data published for the mandatory purpose of the imprint by third parties for the sending of unsolicited advertising and information materials is expressly prohibited. The operators expressly reserve the right to institute legal proceedings in the event of the sending of unsolicited advertising information or so-called spam-mails.</span></p>
