   <button class="accordion">How to know if the accommodation listing is fake or genuine?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p class="fix-class">Its most likely to be a fake posting if:
1) They tell you that they have been transferred to a particular place in Europe very recently and that they will send the keys through couriers.
2) They ask you to pay the entire or partial amount of the deposit even before they arrange a viewing appointment.
3) They ask you to transfer money using Western Union or similar.
4) They ask for your passport or visa specifically (and send theirs even before you ask for it) before fixing a viewing appointment. What happens is that they usually take your identity later on and scam other unsuspecting people.
5) The rent and the location doesn’t even match when compared with the other listings of similar nature, e.g., a 2 room WG at the heart of the city like Maxvorstadt for a warm rent of 800 EUR.
